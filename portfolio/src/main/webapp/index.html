        <h2>What do I like to photograph?</h2>
        <p>I enjoy using high-end DSLR cameras to pictures in auto mode. I find the more I tinker with the cameras settings the worse the image gets, but I like to think I have an eye for taking good pictures. Theres no shame in letting the camera do all the work. I find pictures of urban settings and macro shots of nature to be most beautiful.<p>
